## Karl R. mentioned, in stat 992 class today, that we might think about martingales and RDS. He didn't say more than that at this time. 

A quick search on google scholar showed the article 

It seems that there is some literature on branching processes and population size estimation. @klebaner1984geometric has a promising title. It also cites @fujimagari1976controlled and @klebaner1984population
