I'm beginning my study of @athreya2012branching.

## Chapter 1: The Galton-Watson Process


A Galton-Watson process is a Markov chain $\lbrace Z_n, n=0,1,2,...\rbrace$ on the non-negative integers.

Define its transition function by a probability function $p_k: k = 0,1,2,...$ such that $\sum_k p_k = 1$ and $p_k \ge 0$ for all k. 

$$P(Z_{n+1} = j | Z_n = i) = p_j^{*i}$$ for $i \ge 1$ and 

$$P(Z_{n+1}=0|Z_n=0) = 1$$



Note that zero is an absorbing state, 


We need to think about *generating functions*. 

$$f(s) = \sum_k p_ks^k$$

Now, let $P_n(i,j)$ be the n-step transition probability and use the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to get:

$$f_n(s) - f_{(n)}(s)$$

The authors say that this is an important result, but I don't yet understand why it is important.
