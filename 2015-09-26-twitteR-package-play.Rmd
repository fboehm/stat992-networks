We want to explore the R package `twitteR`. Let's install from github.

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("geoffjentry/twitteR")
devtools::install_github("SMAPPNYU/smappR")
devtools::install_github("pablobarbera/streamR/streamR")
```

Load the package.


```{r}
library(twitteR)
library(streamR)
library(smappR)
```

We found at http://www.jihadica.com/the-%E2%80%98who%E2%80%99s-who%E2%80%99-of-the-most-important-jihadi-accounts-on-twitter/, accessed at 18:49 on 26 September 2015,

a list of supposedly important terrorists with twitter accounts. We decided to examine the followers of one name from this list, WaleedGaj2002. 


```{r}
fols<- getFollowers(screen_name="WaleedGaj2002", oauth_folder = "~/Dropbox/credentials", sleep=65)
```
